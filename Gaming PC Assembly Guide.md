# Gaming PC Assembly Guide

Building a gaming computer is a rewarding and precise process. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the steps involved, from initial planning to final operating system installation.

## Initial Planning & Component Selection

### Acquire a Component List

Establish a budget and define the intended use of the computer. Plan the build around the desired performance and graphical fidelity. Utilize a compatibility checker tool on a site such as [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) to prevent common assembly errors. Purchase components from a variety of reputable online retailers, including [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/), and [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/). Consult the manufacturers' websites and community forums to cross-reference compatibility and resolve potential issues.

## Component Inventory

### Select and Procure Hardware

Select the core components based on the planned build. Secure all parts before beginning assembly.

* **CPU:** Choose between Intel Core and AMD Ryzen processors. The CPU's socket type dictates the compatible motherboards.

* **GPU:** Select a graphics card from either Nvidia GeForce or AMD Radeon. This component provides graphical processing power and is a primary determinant of gaming performance.

* **Motherboard:** Find a motherboard compatible with the chosen CPU. Verify it supports the desired amount of RAM and storage drives.

* **RAM:** Install a minimum of 16GB of DDR4 or DDR5 RAM for optimal gaming performance.

* **Storage:** Use a solid-state drive (SSD), specifically an M.2 NVMe model, for the operating system and key applications. A larger hard disk drive (HDD) provides space for bulk storage.

* **PSU:** Select a power supply unit with sufficient wattage to power all components. Choose a model with a high-efficiency certification (e.g., 80 Plus Gold).

* **Case:** Pick a computer case with adequate space for the components and good airflow.

* **CPU Cooler:** A dedicated CPU cooler is essential for heat dissipation. Many CPUs include a stock cooler, but an aftermarket unit can provide superior performance.

* **Fans:** Install supplemental fans to improve overall case airflow and cooling efficiency.

* **Peripherals:** Choose a keyboard and mouse that feel comfortable and responsive.

* **Monitor:** Select a monitor that matches the output capability of the chosen GPU. A high refresh rate (144Hz+) enhances the gaming experience.

* **Network Card:** Use the integrated network card on the motherboard for a wired connection, or acquire a Wi-Fi card for a wireless setup.

## Preparation & Tools

### Gather Necessary Equipment

Assemble the required tools and prepare the workspace before handling any components.

* **Phillips-head Screwdriver:** Acquire a single screwdriver with a magnetic tip.

* **Cable Ties:** Use zip ties or velcro straps for clean cable management.

* **Anti-Static Wrist Strap:** Attach a wrist strap to a metal part of the case to prevent static discharge from damaging sensitive components.

* **Thermal Paste:** Apply a small amount of thermal paste to the CPU's heat spreader before installing the cooler.

## The Assembly Process

### Construct the System

Assemble the components in a logical order to streamline the build.

1. **Prepare the Motherboard:** Lay the motherboard on its box. Insert the CPU, RAM modules, and M.2 SSDs into their respective slots.

2. **Install Components in the Case:** Mount the power supply unit (PSU) and any case fans into the chassis.

3. **Mount the Motherboard:** Carefully place the motherboard inside the case and secure it with standoff screws.

4. **Install the GPU:** Insert the graphics card into the primary PCIe slot. Install the GPU after the motherboard is mounted to prevent undue stress on the motherboard's PCB.

5. **Connect Cables:** Plug in all power and data cables from the PSU and case to the motherboard, GPU, and storage drives.

6. **Manage Cables:** Route and secure all cables to improve airflow and create a clean aesthetic.

## System Configuration

### Power On and Enter BIOS

The system's firmware must be configured before the operating system is installed.

1. **Initial Boot:** Connect the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Power on the system. Press the designated key (commonly DEL or F2) to enter the BIOS menu.

2. **BIOS Settings:**

3. **Enable XMP/DOCP:** Configure the RAM to run at its advertised speed by enabling the eXtreme Memory Profile (XMP) or similar setting.

4. **Set Boot Order:** Prioritize the bootable USB drive as the first boot option.

5. **Check Hardware:** Verify that the BIOS correctly detects all components, including the CPU, RAM, and storage drives.

### Install the Operating System

Install the chosen operating system and all necessary drivers.

1. **Obtain a License:** Purchase an official license key for the selected operating system. Affordable licenses can be purchased on sites such as [Kingquin](https://kingquin.net/) or directly through [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-11-home/dg7gmgf0krt0/).

2. **Create Installation Media:** Download the official media creation tool from the developer's website. Use the tool to create a bootable USB drive (8GB or larger).

3. **Boot from USB:** Reboot the computer. The system will automatically boot from the USB drive. Follow the on-screen prompts for language, license agreement, and drive selection.

4. **Install Drivers:** After the OS installation, download and install the latest drivers for the motherboard, GPU, and other components from the manufacturers' websites.
