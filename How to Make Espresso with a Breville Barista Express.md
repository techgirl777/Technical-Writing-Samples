# How to Make Espresso with a Breville Barista Express

The Breville Barista Express is an all-in-one espresso machine that grinds, doses, and extracts espresso. This guide will walk you through the steps to pull a perfect shot.

## Step 1: Prepare the Machine

* **Fill the Water Tank:** Ensure the water tank is full with filtered water. This is crucial for both the taste of your espresso and the longevity of the machine.
* **Insert Beans:** Fill the bean hopper with fresh, quality espresso beans. For best results, use beans that were roasted within the last 2-3 weeks.
* **Warm Up:** Turn on the machine and allow it to pre-heat for at least 15-20 minutes. This ensures the thermocoil and portafilter are at the optimal temperature for extraction. The machine will beep when it's ready.

## Step 2: Grind the Beans

* **Select a Filter Basket:** Choose the correct size filter basket for your shot (single or double) and place it in the portafilter.
* **Adjust Grind Size:** The grind size is the most important factor in a good espresso. Start with the "10" setting on the grinder. You'll likely need to adjust this based on your beans and desired shot time.
* **Dose the Portafilter:** Insert the portafilter into the grinding cradle. Press and hold the "FILTER SIZE" button to select the appropriate dose. Press and release the portafilter to start the grind. The machine will grind for a set time.

## Step 3: Tamp and Prep

* **Level the Grounds:** Use your finger or a dosing funnel to level the coffee grounds in the portafilter.
* **Tamp:** Use the included tamper to apply firm, even pressure to the coffee puck. The goal is to create a level, compact surface. A good tamp helps prevent channeling, which leads to uneven extraction.
* **Wipe the Rim:** Use your hand or a cloth to wipe any stray coffee grounds from the rim of the portafilter. This ensures a clean seal with the group head.

## Step 4: Pull the Shot

* **Insert the Portafilter:** Lock the portafilter firmly into the group head. The handle should be turned to the center position.
* **Place Your Cup:** Place your cup(s) on the drip tray directly under the spouts.
* **Start the Extraction:** Press the "1 CUP" or "2 CUP" button to begin extraction. You can also manually pull a shot by pressing and holding the button, and releasing it when you have reached your desired volume.
* **Observe the Flow:** Watch the espresso as it comes out. It should start with a dark color, then become a rich, reddish-brown. The flow should be a steady, honey-like stream.

## Step 5: Adjust and Enjoy

* **Ideal Shot Time:** For a double shot, the ideal extraction time is between 25-30 seconds, yielding about 2 ounces of espresso.
* **Troubleshooting:**
    * **Shot is too fast (under 25 seconds):** The grind is too coarse. Adjust the grind size to a finer setting.
    * **Shot is too slow (over 30 seconds) or not coming out:** The grind is too fine. Adjust the grind size to a coarser setting.
* **Clean Up:** Once you've finished, remove the portafilter and knock out the used coffee puck. Wipe down the group head with a cloth.

Enjoy your freshly brewed espresso!
